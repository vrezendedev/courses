# **The Modern Javascript Bootcamp Course (2022)**
#### **All apps were created alongside this course.**
Within the app folder you will find a READ ME detailing what has been done.

------------


**After developing each app with the instructor, if needed, I will refactor the code in order to make things polished and steady.**

Overall, pretty decent course that will teach you the core aspects (fundamental and advanced) of JavaScript...
