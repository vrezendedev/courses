# **Timer App**
#### **Study Core:**
- Classes;
- Set Interval and Clear Interval;
- SVGs;
- CSS Animation;
- CSS and SVG Attributes.

After finishing the project alongside the instructor I decided to refactor just a little:
1.  Circle animation resets after changing timer duration value;
2.  Center timer on body;
3.  Adjust animation in order to make it smoother.
